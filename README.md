# Pilgrim
A super simple and minimalist software designed to create a blog in just a few minutes.

## Features

- **Simplicity**: Just copy the folder to your server and configure the `config.php` file.
- **Protection**: Secure the `posts` and `uploads` folders with `.htaccess`.
- **Minimalism**: No complicated extensions or themes, focused purely on writing and maintaining privacy.

## Installation

1. **Copy the folder to the server**:
   - Download or clone the repository.
   - Upload the software folder to your server.

2. **Configure `config.php`**:
   - Open the `config.php` file and adjust the settings as needed.

3. **Protect sensitive folders**:
   - Secure the `posts` and `uploads` folders using `.htaccess`.

## Philosophy

This software was created out of a need for simplicity. Most blogging systems are overly complicated, filled with extensions and themes, and focused more on social networking and monetizing content than on writing itself. Pilgrim draws inspiration from various other blogging systems to offer a perfectly functional and minimalist tool.

## Customization

You can easily edit the styles, access points, and links. If you appreciate a minimalist approach and value your words and privacy, I recommend checking out:

- [Hyvor Blogs](https://blogs.hyvor.com/)
- [Mataroa Blog](https://mataroa.blog/)

These two systems have inspired the creation of this software for personal use.
